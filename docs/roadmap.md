# SNORE Roadmap

Complete project overview showing implemented features and future development plans.

---

## Project Vision

**SNORE** (Sleep eNvironment Observation & Respiratory Evaluation) is a CLI-first sleep analysis tool with programmatic event detection and extensible analysis modes.

**Key principles:**
- **CLI-first:** Scriptable, automatable, fast iteration on algorithms
- **ResMed-focused:** Direct import from ResMed devices (other manufacturers via OSCAR export)
- **Programmatic analysis:** Configurable detection modes (AASM, AASM Relaxed, ResMed)
- **Web UI:** Visualization layer consuming API backend

**Language:** Python 3.13+
**Database:** SQLite with Alembic migrations

  - Add enabled flag to Session model (defaults to true)
  - Filter disabled sessions from day aggregation and statistics
  - CLI: `snore session enable/disable <id>` with automatic day recalculation
  - CLI: `snore session list --all` to show disabled sessions

## In Progress 🚧

### Phase 2: Web UI

**Sub-phase 2.2: Vue Frontend** ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Project scaffolding (Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite)
- [x] Design system: shadcn-vue + Tailwind CSS v4 with dark mode (replaced PrimeVue)
- [x] API client layer (12 modules matching all backend routers)
- [x] 13 views: Dashboard, Session List, Session Detail, Stats, Analysis, Event Explorer, RX History, Import, Export, Analysis Management, Database, Validation, Day Detail
- [x] 15+ components: Sidebar, StatCard, TrendChart, CalendarHeatmap, WaveformChart, PaginationBar, DeleteConfirmDialog, etc.
- [x] Waveform rendering with uPlot
- [x] Full CLI parity: Import, Export, Batch Analysis, Validation, Database Management, Waveform Compare, Bulk Delete
- [x] Column sorting on SessionListView (server-side via `sort_by` param)
- [x] uPlot dark mode theming (axis/grid colors rebuild on theme toggle)
- [x] Mobile-responsive layout (sidebar → hamburger via Sheet overlay)
- [x] Skeleton loading states (Dashboard, SessionList, SessionDetail)
- [x] OpenAPI type audit (`AnalysisResult` now generated; `TrendData`/`RecordsData` kept hand-maintained)

### Phase 2.2e: Devices Page (2026-07-05)
- [x] **Devices page** — one card per device with identity grid (firmware, hardware, product code, first seen, last import), usage summary (session count, first/last date, total hours, therapy modes), current settings grouped by category (Therapy, Comfort, Other), and a settings-change timeline diffed across all keys
- [x] **`GET /devices/{device_id}`** — new `DeviceDetail` response (usage, current_settings, settings_history); device listing moved from `DatabaseService` to new `DeviceService`

#### Deliberately deferred (not built in this phase)
- **Profiles endpoint** — vestigial after the device-centric model (days link directly to devices via `device_id`; `Profile` table retained for schema compatibility)
- **Standalone `detected_patterns` query endpoint** — episodes already visible via stored `AnalysisResult` JSON; a dedicated endpoint adds no new data
- **Web log viewer** — `snore logs show/clear/path` remains CLI-only for now
- **`analysis_results.processing_time_ms` display** — field is stored but not surfaced in any UI view

---

## Planned Features 📋

_(Phase 2: Web UI moved to "Recently Completed" section above)_

---

### Phase 3: Reporting & Data Management

**Goal:** Generate reports and manage data lifecycle

- [x] **HTML statistics report** - Self-contained summary + comparison reports with inline-SVG charts (`snore report`, `/reports`); print-to-PDF via browser
- [ ] **CSV export enhancements:**
  - Summary mode: Per-day aggregated statistics
  - Sessions mode: Per-session data
  - Details mode: Events with full session context
  - Export all waveform types to CSV (not just flow)
  - Include therapy settings in session exports
  - Include all statistics fields in summary exports
- [ ] **PDF report generation** - Printable reports with graphs
- [ ] **Journal/notes per day** - User annotations and observations
- [ ] **Database backup/restore** - Export/import database with integrity checks
- [ ] **Minutes at pressure distribution** - Histogram of time spent at each pressure level

---

### Phase 4: Enhanced Analysis

**Goal:** Extend analysis algorithms beyond current capabilities

- [ ] **Additional hypopnea modes** - User-configurable thresholds and criteria
- [ ] **Sleep efficiency estimates** - Calculate efficiency from session times and gaps
- [ ] **Advanced flow analysis** - Flow shape clustering, inspiratory/expiratory pattern analysis
- [ ] **Predictive modeling** - AHI prediction based on settings changes

---

### Phase 4.5: Performance Optimization

**Goal:** Further optimize import pipeline for faster session parsing

- [ ] **Parallel file parsing within sessions** - Parse SA2/BRP/PLD files concurrently using ThreadPoolExecutor
  - Refactor `_parse_statistics()` to return data instead of mutating session object
  - Refactor `_parse_breathing_waveforms()` to return data
  - Refactor `_parse_pressure_leak()` to return data
  - Merge results from parallel parsing into session object

**Note:** Phases 1-4 of import optimization already complete (3-5x speedup achieved). This is the remaining work.

---

### Phase 5: Oximetry

**Goal:** Standalone oximeter support and enhanced SpO2 analysis

- [ ] **Standalone oximeter file import:**
  - Contec CMS50D+ (SpOR files)
  - Viatom/Wellue (native format)
  - ChoiceMMed MD300W1 (DAT files)
- [ ] **Live oximeter streaming** - Real-time SpO2/pulse via serial port (pyserial)
- [ ] **SpO2/pulse correlation** - Correlate desaturations with respiratory events
- [ ] **Oximetry-specific statistics:**
  - ODI (Oxygen Desaturation Index)
  - Average SpO2, time below thresholds
  - Pulse variability metrics

---

### Phase 6: Sleep Staging

**Goal:** Integrate sleep stage data from EEG devices

- [ ] **Zeo CSV import** - Sleep stages (Wake, REM, Light, Deep), ZQ score, awakenings
- [ ] **Dreem CSV import** - Sleep stages, sleep metrics, headband data
- [ ] **Sleep stage overlay** - Display stages on waveforms
- [ ] **Per-stage event analysis:**
  - AHI during REM vs NREM
  - Flow limitation by sleep stage
  - Positional effects by stage
- [ ] **Sleep efficiency calculations** - SE, total sleep time, WASO
- [ ] **Arousal data** - Import EEG-based arousals from Dreem/Zeo (not ResMed RERA)

**Note:** ResMed CPAP devices do NOT have EEG sensors. "Arousal" events in ResMed data are RERA (flow-based), already imported.

---

### Phase 7: Position Tracking (via Somnopose)

**Goal:** Analyze positional effects on sleep apnea

- [ ] **Somnopose CSV import** - Orientation, inclination, movement
- [ ] **Position overlay** - Display position data on waveforms
- [ ] **Positional AHI analysis:**
  - AHI supine vs lateral vs prone
  - Event type breakdown by position
  - Time in each position
- [ ] **Position-correlated statistics** - Pressure, leak, SpO2 by position

**Note:** ResMed CPAP devices do NOT have position sensors. Requires external device (Somnopose or phone app).


---

## Out of Scope (Use OSCAR)

**Not planned for SNORE:**
- Direct import for non-ResMed CPAP devices (Philips, Fisher & Paykel, DeVilbiss, etc.)
- Live device communication (SNORE imports from SD card only)
- Proprietary binary format reverse-engineering (DreamStation 2 encrypted files, etc.)

**Rationale:** Users can import non-ResMed devices via OSCAR, then export to OSCAR format for SNORE import (full OSCAR parser implemented).

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Why ResMed-only direct import?

**Pros:**
- ResMed uses standard **EDF+ format** (well-documented, pyedflib support)
- No reverse-engineering required
- Clean separation: parser reads standard format → unified model

**Cons of supporting other manufacturers:**
- Philips uses **proprietary encrypted formats** (AES-GCM, reverse-engineered)
- Fisher & Paykel, DeVilbiss, Lowenstein all have custom binary formats
- Maintenance burden of 10+ device parsers

**Solution:** Users import other devices via OSCAR desktop app, then use SNORE's OSCAR parser.

---

### Why CLI-first?

**Benefits:**
- **Scriptable** - Automate analysis workflows, batch processing
- **Fast iteration** - No UI dependencies for algorithm development
- **Testing** - Easy to test CLI commands vs GUI interactions
- **Power users** - Direct access to all functionality
- **Web UI** - Visualization layer consuming API backend

CLI remains as automation/scripting interface alongside the web UI.

---

### Why SQLite?

**Benefits:**
- **Zero configuration** - No database server setup
- **Portable** - Single file, easy backup
- **Sufficient performance** - Single-user workloads, millions of rows
- **Easy migration** - Alembic schema evolution

**Limitations accepted:**
- No concurrent writes (single user = not a problem)
- No built-in replication (backup via file copy)

---

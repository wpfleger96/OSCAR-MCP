"""Shared fixtures for all unit tests.

Includes:
- import job store reset (autouse) — safe no-op for tests that never touch
  the store; MCP tests run against an always-empty store with no overhead.
- MCP roundtrip fixtures (mcp_client_factory, mock_db_session) — provide an
  in-memory fastmcp.Client environment with the lifespan patched to a
  lightweight mock (no real database or filesystem access required).

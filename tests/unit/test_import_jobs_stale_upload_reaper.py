"""Unit tests for the stale PENDING_UPLOAD reaper and periodic spool sweep.

Verifies that abandoned multi-chunk uploads are reclaimed after the idle timeout
expires, that active uploads are left alone, that capacity counters are correctly
released, that get_live_spool_dirs tracks in-flight jobs, and that the reaper
thread invokes the optional spool_sweep_fn each iteration.

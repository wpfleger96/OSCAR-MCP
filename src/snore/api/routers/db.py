    Two modes selected via the request body:

    ``include_accounts=false`` (default):
        Delete all sleep data (devices, sessions, waveforms, events, statistics,
        settings, analysis results, breaths, detected patterns, days, import job
        records) and purge every ``raw/<profile_id>/`` backup directory.
        User accounts, auth identities, invites, and profile containers are
        preserved.  Safe for multiuser deployments — users keep their accounts
        and can re-import data afterward.

    ``include_accounts=true``:
        Full factory reset (every row in every table) plus raw-dir purge and
        vacuum.  A fresh bootstrap admin invite is created for
        the calling admin's email and returned in ``bootstrap_invite_url``.  The
        caller's session is immediately dead; they must redeem that URL to regain
        access.

    The response carries ``Cache-Control: no-store`` so the one-time
    ``bootstrap_invite_url`` is never cached by a proxy or browser.

    VACUUM runs as a post-response background task.  ``size_after_mb`` is null
    and ``vacuum_scheduled`` is true in the response when VACUUM is queued.
    A persistent marker file is written before the commit so that a container
    restart between commit and VACUUM causes startup to reschedule the VACUUM.

    Crash-safe cleanup (quarantine-before-commit pattern): raw backup dirs are
    renamed into ``.quarantine/`` BEFORE the commit.  A crash between quarantine
    and commit leaves dirs in ``.quarantine/`` for ``DeletionSaga.recover()``
    case 2 to sweep on next boot; DB rows survive so the state is consistent.
    New imports proceed normally — re-upload deduplication makes the loss
    harmless.

    Note: this handler holds the SQLite write lock for the entire delete+commit,
    so on large databases concurrent import/analysis writers may hit their 5 s
    busy timeout — operators should quiesce imports before a factory reset.

"""Shared in-memory job machinery for the import and analysis pipelines.

``import_jobs`` and ``analysis_jobs`` are structural twins: both keep an
in-memory store of jobs guarded by a store lock, model each job as a
lock-guarded state machine with a cancel flag, and drain a FIFO queue from one
or more persistent worker threads.  This module single-sources the parts that
are genuinely identical between them:

- :class:`JobRecordBase` — the lock/state/cancel/timestamp core of a job.
- :class:`JobStore` — the ``{job_id: job}`` dict + lock, owner-visibility
  filter, and terminal-TTL reap.
- :func:`run_worker_loop` — the ``wait → dequeue → execute`` worker skeleton
  with its BaseException guard (log, force terminal, never re-raise).

Deliberately NOT unified here (they diverge in ways that matter):

- ``_finish`` / ``finish`` terminal transitions — import embeds the durable
  import result and broadcasts SSE observers; analysis records an error
  message.  Each subclass keeps its own.
- Observer / SSE machinery — import only.
- Two-phase admission, capacity accounting, queue eviction — policy that stays
  local to each module.
- Worker-thread topology (single deposable import worker vs N analysis
  workers) and stop-event bookkeeping — a caller concern.

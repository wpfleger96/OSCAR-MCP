"""In-memory FIFO analysis job queue.

By default, 4 admitted analysis jobs run concurrently — sized for a typical
4-5 worker compute pool so CPU is fully utilized without piling unstarted jobs
onto the process pool.  Set ``SNORE_ANALYSIS_JOB_CONCURRENCY`` to override.
Within each job, sessions run with configurable per-job concurrency
(``SNORE_ANALYSIS_MAX_WORKERS``, default 4): the write gate serializes SQLite
writes while the read/compute phases overlap safely.  CPU across all concurrent
jobs is capped globally by the shared ProcessPoolExecutor
(``SNORE_COMPUTE_MAX_WORKERS``).  Jobs are retained for JOB_TTL_SECONDS after
completion for status queries, then reaped.

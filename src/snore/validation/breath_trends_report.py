Breath-trends validation report models and exporters.

Cross-validates SNORE's per-breath respiratory metrics against the device's
independent 0.5 Hz trend signals (rr, tv, ti, ie_ratio).

Channel semantics
-----------------
Four device channels are compared against SNORE's per-breath segmentation:

``rr`` (bpm)
    Device: respiratory rate at 0.5 Hz, range [0, 90].
    SNORE:  instantaneous RR = 60 / (end_offset_s − start_offset_s).
    Device values are windowed/smoothed; SNORE values are instantaneous —
    MAE captures the expected smoothing divergence.

``tv`` (mL)
    Device: tidal volume at 0.5 Hz, stored in mL (converted from L at import),
    range [0, 4000].
    SNORE:  ``tidal_volume_ml`` column (mL).

``ti`` (s)
    Device: inspiratory time at 0.5 Hz, range [0, 10].  VAuto (bilevel) only;
    APAP sessions will report this channel as ``channel_not_recorded``.
    SNORE:  ``inspiration_time_s`` column (s).

``ie_ratio`` (percentage points)
    Device: I:E ratio assumed to be expressed as Ti/Te × 100 (e.g., a 1:2
    inspiration-to-expiration ratio → ie_ratio = 50).  VAuto only.
    SNORE:  100 × inspiration_time_s / expiration_time_s.
    Note: observed device data shows a +40 pp mean bias relative to SNORE's
    computation, suggesting the device may report the unitless Ti/Te ratio
    directly rather than Ti/Te × 100.  The exact device convention is
    unconfirmed; verification is future work.

Zero-average masking
--------------------
After aligning the device trend over each breath window, pairs where the
device-side average equals exactly 0.0 are dropped before metric computation.
Rationale: a real breath cannot produce a zero-average device sample (zeros in
the device signal occur at mask-off/no-breathing regions); any breath window
whose device average rounds to zero is dominated by trailing mask-off fill
values and is noise, not signal.  NaN (windows with no device samples at all)
are dropped by the same pass.

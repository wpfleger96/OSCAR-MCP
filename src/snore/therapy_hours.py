"""Single source of truth for the "hours" denominator of AHI-family indices.

AHI, OAI, CAI, HI, RDI and related rates are all ``events / hours``.  Before
issue #275 four incompatible denominators had grown up independently across the
parsers, the analysis service and the CLI display layer (mask-on time, session
span, waveform sample coverage, and ad-hoc timestamp deltas), so the same night
could yield different indices depending on which code path computed them.

This module defines the denominator once.  Each call selects exactly one basis
and never silently falls back to another: a caller that needs a fallback must
request the next basis itself and decide what an absent input means.  This keeps
the "unknown" case (input missing) distinct from the "known-zero" case (input
present but empty), which the AHI computation must treat differently.

    """Compute the therapy-hours denominator for a single basis.

    Exactly one basis is evaluated per call; there is no hidden fallback
    between bases.  ``None`` means the requested basis's input is absent
    ("unknown"), which callers must distinguish from a returned ``0.0``
    ("known-zero") — in particular an empty ``mask_on_segments`` list is
    known-zero and must not be replaced by the session span.

    Each basis owns exactly the kwargs it reads (``MASK_ON`` →
    ``mask_on_segments``; ``SESSION_SPAN`` → ``span_seconds``;
    ``WAVEFORM_COVERAGE`` → ``sample_count`` + ``sample_rate``).  Passing a
    non-``None`` kwarg that belongs to another basis raises ``ValueError``
    rather than ignoring it, so a mis-routed or mistyped argument fails loudly
    instead of degrading into the "unknown" fallback.

    Args:
        basis: Which measurement to derive the hours from.
        mask_on_segments: ``(start, end)`` pairs in seconds of mask-on wear,
            for ``MASK_ON``.  ``None`` is unknown; ``[]`` is known-zero.
        span_seconds: Session span in seconds, for ``SESSION_SPAN``.
        sample_count: Number of waveform samples, for ``WAVEFORM_COVERAGE``.
        sample_rate: Sample rate in Hz, for ``WAVEFORM_COVERAGE``.

    Returns:
        The denominator in hours, or ``None`` when the requested basis's
        inputs are absent (or ``sample_rate <= 0`` for ``WAVEFORM_COVERAGE``).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If any kwarg not belonging to ``basis`` is not ``None``.

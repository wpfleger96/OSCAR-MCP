SQLite caps bound parameters per statement at SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER: 999 on builds
before 3.32, 32766 after.  Chunking to the 999 floor means an unbounded caller ID list can
never trip ``sqlite3.OperationalError: too many SQL variables`` on any build.  500 matches
the export precedent (``export_service._EXPORT_CHUNK_SIZE``) and leaves headroom for a
handful of *other* bound params in the same statement.  A statement that binds more than one
risky IN-list must chunk each list separately or be split (see the delete-preview count in
session_service).

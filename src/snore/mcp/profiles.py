"""Clinical profile presets for SNORE MCP.

Profiles shape the INSTRUCTIONS resource and suggested-priority hints only (G1).
No tool returns different *data* per profile — thresholds and severity ladders
live here in the instructions text, not in tool response logic.

Profiles available:
    neutral (default) — no clinical framing; reports all indices equally.
    uars — de-emphasizes AHI; leads with flow morphology and RERA/RDI.
    osa  — AHI-forward; emphasises obstructive event burden and compliance.
    csa  — leads with MV, periodic breathing, and central event characterization.

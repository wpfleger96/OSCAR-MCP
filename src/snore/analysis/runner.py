"""Single-session analysis runner: load → prepare → compute → store.

``run_one`` is the shared pipeline behind ``AnalysisFacade.run_analysis`` and
``BatchAnalysisCoordinator``: it owns a short read scope for the I/O phase
(closed before compute), dispatches the CPU-bound compute phase per the
``Dispatch`` policy, and persists the result via ``store_with_retry``.

    Owns a short read scope for the I/O phase and closes it before compute,
